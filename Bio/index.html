title: Bio
---
Born in Moscow, Russia in 1992. After graduating from school I went to live and study in the US. From 2010 till early 2013 I was living in Saint Louis, Missouri. I was studying Mechanical Engineering over there but figured that Engineering isn't something I wanna do for living. I switched my major to Computer Science BA and moved to New York.
I passed exams and transfered to Iona College in New Rochelle. But nevertheless my senior year I dropped out from school. I figured that I want to work as a programmer full time but since I didn't have any proper knowledge of a real IT job, I started my career as a Software QA/Tester and worked as an Android tester at Samsung for about 8 months.
After that I got an offer from Sberbank and worked as a Web tester for about two months. While I was there I got into web development and liked it so much that right now I am refining my programming skills and going to continue work as a Front-End developer.
Here are some pics from my trips.
