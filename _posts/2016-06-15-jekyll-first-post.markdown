So far - so good. Jekyll is generating ready-for-upload html pages with posts etc.
Memo: the convention for the posts:  `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows  and includes the necessary <strong>front matter</strong>. - used strong tag. Curious how to use CSS3 to change the appearance of the blog.
Curious if '.ext' could be something other than a ".markdown". 
snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
